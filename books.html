      <p>Jade has spent her life fighting boredom in the terminally ill ward. Surfing the net or reading, she always envied the ability of others to go out and experience the world. She knew her wish to live a normal life was far beyond her reach, but after waking up one morning without the sounds of her life support, she opens her eyes and finds herself with a weak but healthy body in a magical world.</p> 
      <p>As blue game-like system notifications fill her vision, she knows that she'll have to adapt quickly in order to survive… but this is all she ever dreamed of, so Jade is up to the challenge. She will soon realize that you need to be careful what you wish for.</p>
      <p>This is Andara, where her true adventure finally begins.</p>

      <p>Only five days have passed since Jade was brought to a distant world and a new life. Mobile for the first time ever, Jade is given the chance to do something she's always wanted: attend school.</p>
      <p>Dracona isn't your typical school, however. In Andara she needs to learn all the skills an adventurer needs. For her, that means how to cast magic and use weapons without hurting herself. She'll have to learn fast because the obstacle course isn't the only thing challenging her progress; she's racing against the clock to learn how to beat the Mesmer before they find her.</p>
      <p>With both enemies and allies all around, Jade must hit the ground running, because what's chasing her may be worse than the hospital bed she left behind. Turns out that adapting to a new world is only the first step.</p>

      <p>It's been ten days since Jade finally got out. Out of the bed she spent her life trapped in, out of the hospital, and now out of the city, the walls, and way outside of her comfort zone.</p>
      <p>The wilderness is a terrifying place, especially when you're hunting mesmer…and everything else is hunting you. Unfortunately, getting out of the forest won't get her out of the woods. She’ll need to navigate court politics and foreign policy if she wants to come out in one piece. Paving a way through state affairs will prove at least as difficult as trying to find her way through Basaigh Woods.</p>
      <p>Andara’s newest traveler has a lot on her plate; it’s a good thing she’s hungry for adventure!</p>
